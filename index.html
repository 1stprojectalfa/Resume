    </div>
  </div>
  <ul class="experience-item">
    <li>Developed features and provided bugfixes in services on a full stack environment that used Typescript and React
      on the frontend, .NET 6.0 on the backend, and SNMP for hardware interactions against a software defined radio.</li>
    <li>Developed a Java based application that acted as middleware between gRPC clients and services subscribed to a
      Kafka message broker.</li>
    <li>Conducted a trade study that evaluated the suitability of using Kubernetes to deploy existing services,
      documented results explaining scalability requirements and provided a set of helm charts as proof of concept.</li>
    <li>Lead a team of 4 Software Engineer Interns in an effort that used Ansible, Bash, Python and Docker Compose to
      automate
      the deployment and the configuration settings of over 15 microservices. </li>
    <li>Mentored 5 Software Engineer Interns in the timespan of two summers, successfully lead 3 members of this
      internship cohort into full time positions.</li>

  <ul class="experience-item">
    <li>Designed and implemented a backend message exchange framework using C++, PInvoke and .NET 6.0; this framework
      was used as one the main libraries on over 10 microservices that spanned over 2 different projects.
    </li>
    <li>Created a micro frontend prototype for a React application using Webpack's Module Federation Plugin; this micro
      frontend prototype later turned into a reusable frontend core app that got extended by 2 different teams.</li>
    <li>Developed a C# based application that simulated orbital data and transmitted data via protobuff messages over a TCP based connection.</li>
    <li>Maintained CI/CD pipelines for the hosting, building and packaging of code using Bash, Bamboo, Bitbucket,
      Docker, Curl, Jfrog, Maven, Npm, .NET 6.0 and Webpack.</li>
    <li>Maintained the deployment files used in demonstrations to internal teams and to external customers; successfully
      supported demonstrations that resulted in the acquisition of 3 different contracts.</li>
    <li>Maintained Docker files for microservice applications, deployed event driven micro services using
      Docker Compose.</li>
    <li>Mentored 2 Software Engineer Interns in the timespan of two summers, successfully lead both interns into full
      time positions.</li>
